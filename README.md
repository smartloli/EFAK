# Kafka Eagle

This is an monitor system and monitor your kafka clusters, and visual consumer thread,offsets,owners etc.

When you install [Kafka Eagle](https://www.kafka-eagle.org/), you can see the current consumer group,for each group the topics that they are consuming and the offsets, lag, logsize position of the group in each topic. This is useful to understand how fast you are consuming from a message queue and how quick the message queue is increase. This will help you debuging kafka producers and consumers or just to have an idea of what is going on in your system.

The system shows the trend of consumer and producer trends on the same day, so you can see what happened that day.

Supported on kafka version: ``` 0.8.2.x ```,``` 0.9.x ```,``` 0.10.x ```,``` 0.11.x ```,``` 1.x ```,``` 2.x ``` .

# Kafka Offset Types

Kafka is designed to be flexible on how the offsets are managed. Consumer can choose arbitrary storage and format to persist kafka offsets. Kafka Eagle currently support following popular storage format:
  * Zookeeper. Old version of Kafka (0.8.2 before) default storage in Zookeeper.
  * Kafka. New version of Kafka (0.10.0 in the future) default recommend storage in Kafka Topic(__consumer_offsets).
  
Kafka Eagle supports multiple offset storage paths. If you store them in Zookeeper and Kafka, you can configure them like this.
```
# Set kafka cluster alias
kafka.eagle.zk.cluster.alias=cluster1,cluster2

# Set kafka cluster zookeeper address
cluster1.zk.list=xdn1:2181,xdn2:2181,xdn3:2181
cluster2.zk.list=tdn1:2181,tdn2:2181,tdn3:2181

# Set kafka cluster offset storage path
cluster1.kafka.eagle.offset.storage=kafka
cluster2.kafka.eagle.offset.storage=zookeeper
```

# Kafka SQL

Use the SQL statement to query the topic message log, and visualize the results, you can read [Kafka SQL](https://docs.kafka-eagle.org/3.Manuals/9.KafkaSQL.html) to view the syntax.
